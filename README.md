# μBee Drone Kit Downloads

This repository contains files for the Midnight Make μBee Drone Kit.

## STL Files

All of the required STL files are in this repository, both individually and as a set that can be printed on medium-sized build plates.

Some of the parts and 3D features are small, so you should make sure that your printer is properly calibrated before printing. No supports are needed. 0.2mm layer height and 20% infill should be sufficient when using PLA.

## Source Code

Source code is coming soon. Stay tuned!
